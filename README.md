# Basic SOS Game
This project implements a basic 2 player SOS game. The players can write **'S'** (left click) or **'O'** (right click) into a square in grid. The purpose of the game is to get "
**'SOS'**. If one player gets one, he/she gets one point. After gaining a point, that player gets another turn.

Feel free to take a look at the code and play with it. Enjoy.
